                    <h1>Information</h1>
                    <p>Fishing is one of the most significant drivers of declines in ocean wildlife populations. Catching fish is not inherently bad for the ocean, except for when vessels catch fish faster than stocks can replenish. The number of overfished stocks globally has tripled in half a century and today fully one-third of the world's assessed fisheries are currently pushed beyond their biological limits. The damage done by overfishing goes beyond the marine environment.</p>

                    <h1>Causes</h1>
                    <p>1. Poor Fisheries Management <br>
                        The fishing industry has long been weighed down by a lack of management oversight and proper government regulations. The rules and regulations we have today have proven to be ineffective when it comes to limiting fishing capacity to sustainable levels. <br>
                        2. Unsustainable Fishing <br>
                        Unsustainable fishing encompasses the use of nets, fishing methods and other fishing gear that catch so much fish to a level that they are endangered. It may also involve catching other sea creatures other than fish in the process. The unwanted animals are called By-catch. And they are normally destroyed and discarded into the sea, and those By-catch may include turtles, cetaceans, young fish, sharks, corals, and seabirds, etc. <br>
                        3. Illegal and Unregulated Fishing Activities <br>
                        Illegal fishing activities include poaching, taking more than the allowed amount of catch, and fishing out of season. According to WWF, illegal fishing accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s catch and up to 50 percent in some fisheries. Unregulated fishing practices that result in grave harm include by-catch and Trawling. Trawling involves scraping along the bottom of the sea to gather fish. This practice is one of the major causes of destruction to marine habitats. <br>
                        4. Economic and Food Needs <br>
                        Market availability and consumer demands are the major factors that determine the amount of fish that fishing companies bring ashore. In the last 100 years, human population has increased in many folds. This has, in turn, pushed the need for food and fish up significantly. Coupled with economic aspirations of fishing industries, these factors have compelled fishers to catch more fish than the seas can replace. <br>
                        5. Government Subsidies <br>
                        Many governments around the world continue to subsidize their fishing equipment. This allows unprofitable fishing entities to survive, eventually leading to overfishing. Today, fishing fleet across the globe is estimated to be up to 250 percent of the actual capacity needed to catch what the world needs. <br>
                        6. Open Access Fisheries <br>
                        The ‘open access’ nature of fisheries is another major problem of overfishing. In light of the fact that there are no or limited property rights, fishermen lack the motivation to leave fish in the water. Moreover, only about 1.5 percent of water bodies have been declared protected areas. And most of those areas still remain accessible to fishermen, exposing them to destruction and depletion.

                    <h1>Impacts</h1>
                    <p>1. Marine Ecosystem Imbalance <br>
                        Targeted catching of essential predators such as sharks, tuna, and billfish disrupts marine ecosystem in the long run. This results in increased numbers of smaller marine animals below the food chain. This ends up affecting the rest of the ecosystem, with issues such as the increased growth of algae. Coral health becomes compromised as well. <br>
                        2. Dwindling Harvests of Targeted Fish <br>
                        The population of fish that is worth consuming is increasingly reducing. Overfishing has led to a decrease in the population of productive fish, resulting in lesser stocking of the fish. There is urgent need to curb overfishing in a bid to restore the dwindling marine population in a couple of years. Limiting fishery activities will allow fish to breed and reproduce, and well will eventually have a great supply of fish available again. <br>
                        3. Unsustainable Aquaculture <br>
                        Fish farming requires feed for reared fish. For example, you will need between four and eleven pounds of prey fish to raise just one pound of farmed salmon. With the rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry, prey fish population is reducing at alarming and untenable rates. <br>
                        4. Socio-economic Impact <br>
                        Millions of people around the world have pegged their livelihood and nutritional needs on fishing. Oceans have supplied us with sufficient seafood for years, but that is no longer the case. Overfishing and untenable fishing practices over the last couple of decades have stripped the oceans of their fish supply. And this has affected many people’s everyday way of life and source of income. With no valuable fish left in the waters to fish, the fishing industry is on the verge of collapse. <br>
                        5. Pollution <br>
                        Fishing boats, trawlers, and vessels hurt marine life not only through overfishing but also through oil and liquid, and chemical spills. You may think that oceans are so expansive that these are not significant threats. However, a slight pollution by thousands of fishing vessels every day results in a massive disturbance. And water pollution has grave consequences to both aquatic and terrestrial lifeforms. <br>
                        6. The plastic soup <br>
                        Plastic soup can seriously damage our environment, not just as poisonous gases spread and reach land, but also when we eat fish with plastic and micro-plastics in them. By ingesting small plastic particles, our bodies can come into contact with different toxic substances.

                    <p>1. Only eat sustainable seafood. <br>
                        2. Avoid big fish, which have been overfished for years, like marlin, tuna and shark. <br>
                        3. Eat small fish – 90% of the big fish are gone, they’re important for the ecosystems, and they’re also very often full of toxic contaminants like lead. <br>
                        4. Buy local. Seafood caught in local North American waters are generally subject to more scrutiny and better regulation than in other parts of the world, plus there is less energy used to store and transport the food. This is especially true for shrimp. <br>
                        5. Go wild, not farmed. Fish farmed in big nets in the ocean pour tons of waste onto the seafood floor, spread disease to wild stocks, and create conflict with local seals, whales, and sharks that are killed when they try to break the nets to eat the fish. It is also an incredibly inefficient way to make food – requiring 6 pounds of wild caught animals to create 1 pound of salmon. This is the biggest problem with eating any kind of Atlantic salmon, which is always farmed in open systems.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>We may dismiss overfishing as a harmless practice oblivious to the fact that it is causing untold harm to the world’s ocean and marine life. Overfishing depletes the population of adult fish and doesn’t leave enough fish to reproduce and replenish their dwindling numbers. This can be attributed to poor fisheries management, unsustainable fishing, economic needs, as well as illegal and unregulated fishing. And its effects include marine life imbalance, loss of income, and harvesting of endangered marine species.</p>
